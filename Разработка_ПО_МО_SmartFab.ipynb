    "SmartFab (Отдел Разработки ПО Искусственного Интеллекта Дивизион Искусственного Интеллекта Технологический блок)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Чем мы занимаемся?\n",
    "Команда решает задачи оптимизации, автоматизации и контроля производственных процессов на Фабрике YADRO (и не только) путем внедрения технологий машинного обучения и анализа данных. В частности, активно используются методы компьютерного зрения, цифровой обработки сигналов и статистика. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Чем предстоит заниматься тебе, если попадешь к нам в рамках Импульс 2025:\n",
    "На стажировке в SmartFab ты сможешь принять участие в разработке одного из продуктов автоматической инспекции, применяемого на производстве. Познакомиться со всеми этапами разработки от постановки задачи до прототипирования систем с AI компонентами на борту для решения практических задач в условиях ограниченного количества данных\n",
    "\n",
    "Во время стажировки нужно будет решать задачи из по анализу и обработке данных фото и видео данных:\n",
    "1. Статистическая работа с разметкой, уточнение требований;\n",
    "2. Эксплораторный анализ данных (EDA); \n",
    "3. Участие в разработке алгоритмов автоматического анализа данных;\n",
    "4. Подготовка выборок для обучения, обучение моделей (ML/DL) и анализ результатов.\n",

    "# Предисловие к заданию\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Можно и нужно гуглить\n",
    "2. Не все задания предполагают написание кода, там, где он нужен будет интуитивно понятно (например первые 2) Но если вам проще размышлять с кодом - вы можете так сделать, это даже приветсвуется.\n",
    "3. Задания предполагают минимальное погружение в предметную область. В заданиях по набору данных копать в генетику не нужно.\n",
    "4. Ответы можно оставлять в этой тетрадке под заголовоком \"Ответ\" после текста задания\n",
    "5. Не стесняйтесь комментировать свои действия, если считаете, что они нужны. Так, например, импорты комментировать не надо :-)\n",
    "6. Даже если вы решили не все - ничего страшного. Присылайте нам решения того, что удалось сделать. Лучше прислать часть ответов, чем не прислать ничего\n",
    "7. Результат каждого задания оценивается в баллах. Даже если вы ошиблись где-то в задании - не беда. Все задание не будет считаться проваленным, а только часть с ошибкой. Но если вдруг вы строите гипотезу на неверных предположениях - то нельзя будет зачесть все остальное, поэтому будьте внимательны. Правильная предпосылка - 50% успеха.\n",

    "Архитектуру модели вы взяли из torchvision/“tensorflow hub”. Модель сходится, на валидации хорошие метрики. Но по результатам визуализации на тестовых данных, вы видите, что модель часто «промахивается» мимо объектов либо их «пропускает». Каковы ваши дейтсвия?"

    "## Ответ\n",
    "Это может быть связано с тем, что на обучающей и валидационной выборке на используем одни объекты, а на тестовых данных пытаемся затедектировать другие, которые модель до этого не видела(Тут нужно или собрать данные того, что мы хотем детектить, или смириться с несовершенностью нашей модели и нашего мира). Также огромную роль играет фон и освещение, поэтому я бы использовал аугументацию(если проблема с осевещением, то можно поиграться с контрастностью картинки). Если модель \"пропускает\" объекты, это может бвть связано с размером объекта(например, если мы \"учим\" модель только на \"больших\" яблоках(яблоко занимает большую часть картинки), не вариант, что она сможет задетектировать \"маленькие\" яблоки). Твкже не нужно требовать от модели чего-то сверх(пример с тем же яблоком, если нам в камеру светит лампочка и мы сами не можем увидеть там яблока, то с чего бы нейросети его там увидеть). Также может быть такой случай, что то же яблоко закрыто каким-то предметом. Если наша модель видела только круглые и целые  яблоки то она может не распознать часть яблока.Я бы предложил если есть силы и возможность самим собрать датасет ну или же попробовать ту же аугументацию(например crop, будем определенным образом вырезать яблоко, оставляя только часть )"

    "Итак буду объяснять испульзуя черновые записи. Камера pinhole работает так, что через малнькую дырочку проходит свет и строит перевернутое изображение на матрице(а точнее симметричное, относительно отверстия в центре(впоследствии буду его называть pinhole)). Нетрудно заметить, что изображение зависит от расстояния, на котором находится объект(в нашем случае параллелепипед, обозначим его за s). Для того, чтобы фигура была видна на матрице, необходимо чтобы все ключевые точки были видны(в нашем случае это координаты вершин). Заметим, что если взять плоский объект который будет \"смотреть на камеру\"(то есть плоскость матрицы и плоскоть объекта параллельны друг другу) то у нас получаться подобные фигуры. Коэффициент подобия обозначим за k(k_a на картинке, так как мы рассматриваем случай для камеры А). Поэтому рассмотрим 2 стороны параллелепипеда s которые \"смотрят\" на камеру А.(они заштрихованы красным цветом). Они находятся на разном расстоянии и поэтому коэффициент подобия будет разным(в первом случае 2, во втором 4, это очевидно из формулы, где s_y координаты плоскости(у нас 2 плоскости,поэтому 2 коэфф. подобия) параллелепипеда по y, p_y координата pinhole_a). Далее мы смотрим минимальные и максимальные координаты используя коэфф подобия и координату pinhole(p_x +- 2k, 2 так как от центра до края расстояние 2 как по оси x, так и по z), по другому это можно назвать perception field, и все, что лежит между этими координатами камера 'видит'. Получили,что 1 объект камера полностью увидит"

    "### Предобработка\n",
    "Здесь мы предобработали данные(заменили '--', на None, также выкинули часть колонок, где нам не был дан возраст людей. Там всего 5 колонок, в принципе можно былол их поменять на какое-нибудь отрицательное число, так как для catboost в возрасте респондентов должен быть тип int.Но я решил выкинуть, думаю, что не критично. Также на первом этапе смотрел возраст респондентов, аномалий не нашел(возраст был от 14 до 89 лет). Также заменил в Race not_reported на None, так как так и так мы не знаем расу человека.Пропуски с None оставил как есть так как деревья очень хорошо работают с ними. И самое главное, все категориальные признаки преобразовал к str).\n",
    "### Разделение датасета\n",
    " Далее была разделение датасета на train, test и val, test - 10%, val - 15%, train - 75%. Здесь нам необходим val_dataset так как мы хотим выбрать лучшие параметры для catboost при помощи grid_search, а также в процессе обучения следить, чтобы модель не переобучалась.Также я решил разделить данные с учетом того, что выборка несбалансирована(Чтобы процент вхождения класса 1 и класса 0 было одинаковым везде).Хотя в нашей задаче можно было обойтись и без этого. \n",
    "### Выбор модели \n",
    " Далее - выбор модели. Мало данных, они табличные, так еще некоторые имеют пропуски, очевидно, что лучшее решение - градиентный бустинг(В принципе с табличными данными градиентный бустинг был всегда фаворитом. Сейчас по метрикам его обгоняют разве что LLM).\n",
    "### Выбор метрики \n",
    " Переходим к метрикам. Одна из лучших метрик для бинарной классификации - ROC-AUC, она показывает, насколько наша модель хорошо разделяет данные. Минимальное значение ROC-AUC - 0.5(случайное предсказание, как если бы мы подбрасывали монетку), Максимальное - 1. Также посмотрели на Precision и Recall, тоже весьма популярные метрики при работе с бинарной классификацией. Посмотрим на Test и val метрики. Видим, что На тестовой выборке точность оказалась лучше(Если смотреть на ROC-AUC) что свидетельствует, что переобучения быть не должно. Также можно посмотреть на признаки, дающие наибольший вклад в определение типа опухоли. Как мы видели по тепловой карте, было логично ожидать что IDH1 даст наибольший вклад.'CIC' и 'TP53' и возраст тоже влияют на тип опухоли. Остальная информация уже менее существенна. То есть, зная только эти данные, можно с высокой точностью определить тип опухоли  "
